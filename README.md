homebrew-brewg
==============

Custom brews.

Installation
------------

It's pretty easy, you just need homebrew version `0.9` or greater and some
sauce:

    brew tap chuckg/brewg
    brew install package

If the formula conflicts with one in `mxcl/master`, you can explicitly target
a formula from `home-brewg`:

    brew install chuckg/brewg/package

Cheers.
